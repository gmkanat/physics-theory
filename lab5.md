- 6.5. Control questions 
1. Specify viscosity.
Viscosity is a fluid property that represents the resistance to shear within the fluid. It indicates how easily a fluid flows and is a measure of the internal friction within the fluid. 
2. Relationship of dynamic and kinematic viscosities, their SI units.
The dynamic viscosity (η) is related to the kinematic viscosity (ν) by the equation ν = η/ρ, where ρ is the density of the fluid. The SI unit of dynamic viscosity is Pascal-seconds (Pa·s), while the SI unit of kinematic viscosity is square meters per second (m^2/s). 
3. On what physical quantities does viscosity of liquid depend?
The viscosity of a liquid depends on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the nature and properties of the fluid. It is also influenced by the molecular structure and interactions within the fluid. 
4. What forces act on a sphere falling in a liquid?
When a sphere falls in a liquid, three forces act on it: the gravitational force (P1), the buoyant force (P), and the drag force (Fd). The gravitational force pulls the sphere downward, the buoyant force acts upward due to the displaced liquid, and the drag force opposes the motion of the sphere through the liquid. 
5. Why after some moment does motion of a sphere in a liquid become uniform?
After some time, the motion of a sphere in a liquid becomes uniform because it reaches its terminal velocity. Initially, the sphere accelerates under the influence of gravity, but as the drag force increases with increasing velocity, it eventually balances out the gravitational force. At the terminal velocity, the net force on the sphere becomes zero, resulting in a constant velocity. 
6. In what way do the diameters of a sphere and of a vessel influence the motion of a sphere?
The diameters of both the sphere and the vessel can influence the motion of the sphere. In the case of a falling sphere, if the diameter of the vessel is comparable to or larger than the sphere's diameter, the drag force experienced by the sphere will be affected. Stokes' Law, which describes the drag force, assumes that the flow around the sphere is not significantly affected by the presence of the vessel. Therefore, if the vessel diameter is large compared to the sphere diameter, the drag force will be closer to the ideal case described by Stokes' Law. On the other hand, if the vessel diameter is comparable to the sphere diameter, additional factors may come into play, such as wall effects, which can affect the motion and drag force experienced by the sphere.
