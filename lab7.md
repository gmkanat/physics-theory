1. What is the value of magnetic field on the axis of an infinitely long solenoid? Derive this formula from Ampere's law.
Answer:
The value of the magnetic field on the axis of an infinitely long solenoid is given by the formula: B = μ₀nI, where B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space, n is the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid. This formula can be derived from Ampere's law by considering a closed loop path along the axis of the solenoid, applying Ampere's law, and taking into account the symmetry of the solenoid. 
2. Write the Biot-Savart formula in vector and scalar form, and provide a picture for it.
Answer:
The Biot-Savart law describes the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire. In vector form, the Biot-Savart law is given by:

dB = (μ₀/4π) * (I * dℓ x r) / r³,

where dB is the differential magnetic field at a point, μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current flowing through the wire, dℓ is an infinitesimal length element of the wire, r is the vector pointing from the current element to the point of observation, and x represents the cross product.

In scalar form, the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point is given by:

dB = (μ₀/4π) * (I * dℓ * sinθ) / r²,

where θ is the angle between the current element and the vector r.

Here is a diagram illustrating the Biot-Savart law:

1. State the main properties of magnetic field and the main theorems of magnetostatics.
Answer:
The main properties of magnetic fields are as follows:
- Magnetic fields are eddy or solenoidal, unlike electric fields which are potential or irrotational.
- Magnetic field lines form closed loops, unlike electric field lines that start from positive charges and end on negative charges.
- Magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges and alternating electric currents.
- Magnetic fields are not affected by electric charges at rest (electric monopoles) since there are no magnetic monopoles in nature.

The main theorems of magnetostatics are:
- Ampere's Law: It relates the magnetic field circulating around a closed loop to the current passing through the loop. The integral form of Ampere's law states that the line integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space times the sum of the currents passing through the loop.
- Gauss's Law for Magnetism: Unlike Gauss's law for electric fields, Gauss's law for magnetism states that the total magnetic flux through any closed surface is always zero. This is because there are no magnetic monopoles, and magnetic field lines always form closed loops.
- Biot-Savart Law: It describes the magnetic field generated by a steady current. The law states that the magnetic field at a point in space is proportional to the current element, the perpendicular distance from the current element to the point, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance. The Biot-Savart law is fundamental in calculating magnetic fields produced by current-carrying wires or other current distributions.
