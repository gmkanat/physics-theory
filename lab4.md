1. Question: What kinds of conservation laws were used in the given experiment? Formulate them for isolated systems.

Answer: The conservation laws used in the experiment are the conservation of energy and the conservation of angular momentum. Formulated for isolated systems: 
- Conservation of energy: In an isolated system, the total energy remains constant. Energy can be transformed from one form to another, but the total amount of energy remains unchanged. 
- Conservation of angular momentum: In an isolated system, the total angular momentum remains constant. Angular momentum is the product of an object's moment of inertia and its angular velocity. Any changes in the distribution of mass or angular velocity within the system must balance out to maintain the overall conservation of angular momentum.
2. Question: Give the definition of elastic and inelastic interactions of two objects. Provide examples.

Answer: 
- Elastic interaction: In an elastic interaction, two objects collide and rebound without any permanent deformation or loss of kinetic energy. The objects temporarily deform during the collision but return to their original shapes after the interaction. Examples include the collision of two billiard balls or a bouncing ball. 
- Inelastic interaction: In an inelastic interaction, two objects collide and may stick together or deform permanently, resulting in a loss of kinetic energy. The objects do not separate or rebound with their original velocities. Examples include a clay ball sticking to a wall upon impact or a car colliding and crumpling during a crash.
3. Question: Write the laws of conservation for elastic and inelastic collisions of two bodies.

Answer: 
- Conservation laws for elastic collisions:
- Conservation of momentum: The total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.
- Conservation of kinetic energy: The total kinetic energy before the collision is equal to the total kinetic energy after the collision. 
- Conservation laws for inelastic collisions:
- Conservation of momentum: The total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.
- No conservation of kinetic energy: In an inelastic collision, kinetic energy is not conserved, and some or all of the initial kinetic energy is converted into other forms of energy, such as heat or deformation energy.
4. Question: Why is it impossible to find the bullet speed by equalization of the kinetic energy of the bullet to the potential energy of elastic deformation of the thread at the maximal displacement angle of the frame?

Answer: It is impossible to find the bullet speed by equalizing the kinetic energy of the bullet to the potential energy of elastic deformation of the thread at the maximal displacement angle of the frame because the collision between the bullet and the block is not purely elastic. The collision is described as a "sticky" collision, where the bullet and the block stick together and move as a single mass after the collision. In this type of collision, kinetic energy is not conserved, and energy is lost due to the deformation of the bullet and block, as well as other dissipative forces. Therefore, the traditional approach of equating kinetic energy to potential energy cannot be applied accurately in this case.
5. Question: What simplifying conditions were used in the given work?

Answer: The simplifying conditions used in the given work include:
- Neglecting the rotational inertia of the stacked bullet because its mass is small compared to the mass of the frame and additional weights.
- Assuming that the time interval of the collision between the bullet and the block is so short that torques due to the force of gravity and tension of the thread about the vertical axis are zero.
- Neglecting other dissipative forces, such as air resistance, to simplify the analysis.
6. Question: Obtain and characterize the differential equation of torsion oscillations.

Answer: The differential equation of torsion oscillations can be obtained by considering the torque exerted on the frame due to the torsional force of the thread. Let θ represent the angular displacement of the frame from its equilibrium position.

The equation of motion for torsion oscillations can be given as:
I * d²θ/dt² = -k * θ

Where:
- I is the moment of inertia of the frame about its axis of rotation,
- k is the torsion constant of the thread.

This second-order linear differential equation represents the rotational motion of the frame under the influence of the torsion force provided by the thread. Its solution will describe the behavior of the oscillations in the system.
