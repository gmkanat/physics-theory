- 1. What is electric field? Give its main characteristics
(E,φ).
- Electric field is a region in space around a charged object or particle where electric forces are exerted on other charged objects. Its main characteristics are:
- Electric field strength (E): It represents the force experienced by a unit positive charge placed in the field.
- Electric potential (φ): It represents the electric potential energy per unit charge at a specific point in the field. 
2. Speak on properties of electrostatic field: notion of
electric flux, circulation around closed path, divergence, curl
of E.
- Properties of electrostatic field:
- Electric flux: It is a measure of the electric field passing through a given surface.
- Circulation around a closed path: In an electrostatic field, the electric field circulation around a closed path is zero.
- Divergence of E: It represents how much the electric field spreads out or converges at a given point in space.
- Curl of E: In electrostatics, the curl of the electric field is zero, indicating that the field is irrotational. 
3. Speak on principle of superposition of electric fields.
Gauss’ theorem and its application.
- The principle of superposition of electric fields states that the total electric field at a point due to multiple charges is the vector sum of the individual electric fields produced by each charge. Gauss' theorem relates the total electric flux through a closed surface to the total charge enclosed within that surface. 
4. Rules of construction of electric field lines and equipotentials:
- Electric field lines start at positive charges and terminate at negative charges.
- Electric field lines never cross each other.
- Electric field lines are closer together where the field is stronger.
- Equipotential lines are perpendicular to electric field lines.
- Equipotential lines are closer together where the potential difference is greater. 
5. Essence of the method of mathematical simulation 
- The method of mathematical simulation involves using mathematical models and equations to simulate and analyze complex physical phenomena, such as the electric field of charged bodies. By modeling the electric field using current in a medium with low conductivity, similar properties and behaviors can be observed and studied. The potential distribution can be investigated using probes and electrodes that mimic the shape and characteristics of the natural bodies being studied.
